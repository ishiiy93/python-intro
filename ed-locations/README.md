# Education Locations

The U.S. Department of Education's [College Cost](https://collegecost.ed.gov/catc/Default.aspx) website makes available tuition costs on U.S. higher education institutions (downloadable [here](https://collegecost.ed.gov/catc/resources/CATClists2014.xlsx)). However, it **does not** include the addresses of those colleges.

In this exercise, we'll take the following steps to find the geographic locations of each institution:

1. Use python to identify the **links to institution pages** on their [website](https://collegecost.ed.gov/catc/Default.aspx)

2. Visit each instituion page and collect the address

3. Merge location data with the original dataset

4. Use a location service to identify the latitude / longitude of the institution

5. Plot the institutions on an interactive map

This exercise is contained in a Jupyter notebook. You should have the `jupyter notebook` command accessible to you, assuming you've installed the anaconda python distribution.

To start this exercise, navigate to this directory in your terminal, and type `jupyter notebook`, and see `exercise.ipynb`.
